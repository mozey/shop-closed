# closed

See `example.html` for javascript to display a
"shop closed" modal between certain times every day

When the page loads check the `window.myShop.closed` array for closing times.
If the users clock reports a time inside these intervals the shop is closed

The modal HTML, CSS and Javascript is based on 
[this example](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp)

See comments in `example.html` for setup with WordPress.
